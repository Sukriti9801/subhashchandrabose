When the principal told Subhas Chandra Bose that he had been expelled, his reply was  "Thank you very much " and  then he left the college.</li>
        <li><strong>1917 & 1918</strong> - Joined Scottish Church College, receiving his B.A. in 1918 in the First Class with honours in philosophy and secured second position among all philosophy students in Calcutta University. </li>
        <li><strong>1919 & 1920</strong> - Entered in University of Cambridge to study for the Indian Civil Service Examination, placing fourth position with highest marks in English only after eight months of study. </li>
        <li><strong>1921</strong> -  He resigned his candidacy from Civil Service examination as he doubted that if  one is chained on to the civil service, it is not possible to serve one's country in the best and fullest manner . Also he did not want to work for British. He was in a hope of working with Mahatama Gandhi and  Chittaranjan Das for freedom movement. </li>
        <li><strong>1922</strong>-  Started the newspaper Swaraj and took charge of publicity for the Bengal Provincial Congress Committee. His mentor was Chittaranjan Das who was a spokesman for aggressive nationalism in Bengal.</li>
        <li><strong>1923</strong> - Elected as the President of All India Youth Congress and also the Secretary of Bengal State Congress. He was also the editor of the newspaper "Forward", founded by Chittaranjan Das.</li>

        <li><strong>1925</strong>  - Through his newspaper he influenced the minds of  youth of Bengal and neighbouring states for aggessive nationalism.  As a result, thousands of youth, engaged themselves in the war of independence of India due to which Britishers saw it as a potential threat for their rule as Bengal was the Spine of British Rule. Thus, the britishers arrested him but couldn't afford to put him in some prison in India as it may lead to violent resistance and riots, that's why they transferred Netaji to Mandlay Jail, Burma. Although arrested he did not gave up his effort. He continued his nationalist activities and wrote several articles for newspaper.</li>
        <li><strong> 1927</strong> - After getting released from prison, he became general secretary of the Congress party and worked with Jawaharlal Nehru for independence.</li>
        <li><strong>1928</strong> - Organised the Annual Meeting of the Indian National Congress in Calcutta. Presiding over the  Maharashtra Provincial Contents in 1928, he had the courage to oppose the Dominion Status resolution .The young leaders wanted a "complete self-rule and without any compromise’ while the senior leaders were in favour of the "dominion status for India within the British rule". He founded Bengal Volunteer Corps and became the chief officer or  G.O.C ( General Officer Commanding) , prior to Calcutta Congress session of 1928.</li>
        <li><strong>1930</strong> - Arrested for leading an independent procession. After getting released, he got elected as Mayor of Calcutta. </li>
        <li><strong>1931</strong> - Got arrested for leading a huge front by hoisting the National Flag in Kolkata on January 26, when the police launched a blackbuck on him and sent him to jail. When Netaji was in jail, Mahatama Gandhi compromised with the British government and they released all the prisoners except the revolutionaries like Bhagat Singh. Netaji wanted Mahatama Gandhi to break the agreement with the British government on this subject. But Mahatama Gandhi was not willing to break the promise given on his behalf. The British government was stuck in its place and Bhagat Singh and his comrades were hanged. Subhash Bose got annoyed with Gandhiji and Congress as heroes like Bhagat Singh were not saved. Netaji was soon put in jail under the ‘Bengal Act’. During this period, he had to stay in prison for nearly a year and later he was released from prison due to illness. He was released with a condition that he would be never allowed to enter India. He was then sent to Europe. </li>
        <li><strong>1932, 1933 & 1934</strong> - Travelled in Europe, visiting Indian students and European politicians, including Benito Mussolini. He observed party organisation and saw communism and fascism in action. </li>

          <li><strong>1938</strong> -Stated his opinion that the INC "should be organised on the broadest anti-imperialist front with the two-fold objective of winning political freedom and the establishment of a socialist regime." By 1938 he became a leader of national stature and agreed to accept nomination as Congress President. He stood for unqualified Swaraj (self-governance), including the use of force against the British. This meant a confrontation with Mohandas Gandhi, who in fact opposed Bose's presidency</li>
          <li><strong>1939</strong> -  Organised the All India Forward Bloc ( a left wing Indian political party), a faction within the Indian National Congress splitting the Indian National Congress party.</li>
          <li><strong>1940</strong> - Declared Forward Bloc as the socialist political party in its first All India Conference in Nagpur. He was again arrested and detained in Presidency Jail. He got arrested 11 times during his struggle for Indian Independence.</li>
          <li><strong>1941</strong> - Escaped from home arrest by british in Calcutta. He managed to reach Peshawar and from there he escaped in guise to Afghanistan. He then travelled to Moscow in guise on an Italian passport of an Italian nobleman "Count Orlando Mazzotta". From there he travelled to Rome and then reached Germany.  This is one of the greatest escape in History. His main purpose was to free his mother India from the clutches of  British Colonialism. Thus he had to seek help from Nazi Germany. He wanted to unite with Nazi Germany and to fight a war  along with 50,000 soldiers of Indian origin against british in India. After liberating India, he wanted Nazi Germany to hand over responsibility to the Government in Exile headed by him. But Nazi Germany had different plans. They wanted their supremacy all over the world. Although they agreed to Netaji's plan virtually, they hatched a plan to form an ‘Afghan Army’ to invade India after the possible defeat of the Soviet Union in order to snatch the jewels from those  British robbers ( It was India's jewels). Netaji was unaware of their evil plans. After getting to know about their cruel and evil plans and  that he is not going to get help for his country's independence, he decided to move to Japan. In Germany, he also broadcasted to Indian Public through Azad Hind Radio which electrified them.
</li>
          <li><strong>1942</strong> - Even after deciding to leave Germany, he was held up by Germans for whole one year in order to use him for their victory over Russia. He was stuck with a virtual assurance from Germans that he would be assisted for  India's Independence.  He was allowed to leave only after the German surrender in Stalingrad, and Hitler's secret plan for India fell apart. </li>
          <li><strong>1943</strong> - He moved to Japan undertaking a dangerous and physically demanding three month long journey  with another Indian colleague, Abid Hassan, under the sea, which also involved a mid sea transfer from a German U boat to a Japanese submarine. He had to leave behind his wife and only child, daughter Anita, in care of many well wishers in Germany.  On 21st October, 1943, at the Cathay Theater in Singapore, Netaji did proclaim the establishment of the Arzi Hukumat-e-Azad Hindhe, i.e, the Indian National Army (INA), from amongst the Indian soldiers who were held as Prisoners of War. Three days later, he declared war on the British Empire and the USA. </li>
          <li><strong>1944</strong> - April 14 was the day when tricolour was outstreched for the first time on a liberated Indian soil. Led by Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, the Indian National Army (INA) defeated the British, to establish the provisional independent government in Moirang, a sleepy little town about 45 km from Imphal, the capital of Manipur. With the help of Japanese, he also occupied a provincial free government in Andaman and Nicobar Island. </li>
          <li><strong>1945</strong> - In the late 1944 and early 1945, the British Indian army attacked on Japanese forces. Almost half of Japanese forces and half of Indian National Army forces got killed. Japanese surrendered to the Britishers after the recapture of Singapore. Netaji chose not to surrender with his forces to such bloody Britishers.
With the aim to seek help from Soviet Union which is believed to be turning out anti-British, he boarded the plane to Manchuria. It is officially believed that the plane got crashed in Taiwan and he died from third degree burns.</li>
